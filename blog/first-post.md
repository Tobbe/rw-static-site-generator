This is the very first post on my new blog. I will never get tired of blogging and promise one new post per day.

LULZ! Who am I kidding? It'll be one (this) post today. A new one tomorrow, then one next week. If we're lucky the one after that is next month. And that's probably pretty much it... Isn't that how it always goes?

1. Setup a new blog
2. Write "Welcome to my new blog post"
3. Lose interest and keep on with your usual hobbies

And an image, just because I can!
